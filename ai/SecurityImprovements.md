## Overview
This document summarizes the security review of the `redgraz-cv` codebase and provides recommendations for improvement. The project is a Next.js/React-based personal resume website.

---

## 1. Contact Form Security
- **Current State:** ✅ **RESOLVED**
  - The contact form has been completely removed from the application.
  - Files `ContactForm.tsx` and `Contact/index.tsx` have been removed.
  - This eliminates all contact form-related security risks.
- **Status:** No further action required - risk eliminated through removal.

## 2. General Application Security
- **Current State:** ✅ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**
  - No authentication or authorization (expected for a static CV site).
  - No API endpoints are present.
  - No environment variable handling for secrets.
  - **✅ IMPLEMENTED:** Content Security Policy (CSP) and security headers now configured in `next.config.js`:
    - CSP with restrictive policies for scripts, styles, and resources
    - X-Frame-Options: DENY
    - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
    - Referrer-Policy: origin-when-cross-origin
    - Permissions-Policy for camera, microphone, geolocation, payment
- **Remaining Recommendations:**
  - If adding dynamic features or APIs, implement authentication and authorization as needed.
  - Use environment variables for any secrets or API keys.

## 3. Dependencies & Configuration
- **Current State:** ✅ **RESOLVED**
  - **✅ UPDATED:** Now uses Node.js 22 and latest dependencies (updated December 2025):
    - Next.js: v15.1.0 (from v12.1.0)
    - React: v18.3.1
    - TypeScript: v5.7.2 (from v4.5.5)
    - All dev dependencies updated to latest compatible versions
  - Dockerfile runs as a non-root user (good practice maintained).
  - No sensitive data found in config files.
- **Status:** All dependencies up-to-date. Continue regular monitoring for new security advisories.

## 4. Client-side Security
- **Current State:**
  - Uses GSAP and other animation libraries that manipulate the DOM.
  - No user-generated content is stored or rendered, reducing XSS risk.
- **Recommendations:**
  - If accepting user input in the future, sanitize and validate before rendering.
  - Review third-party dependencies for vulnerabilities.

## 5. Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Current State:**
  - Static site deployment with low attack surface.
  - Next.js production optimizations enabled.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) if deploying to public cloud.
  - Enable HTTPS and HSTS in production.

## Summary Table
| Area                | Current State | Status | Recommendations |
|---------------------|--------------|--------|-----------------|
| Contact Form        | ✅ Removed completely | **RESOLVED** | None - risk eliminated |
| Security Headers    | ✅ CSP + security headers implemented | **RESOLVED** | Monitor and update as needed |
| API/Backend         | None         | Good | Secure if added |
| Auth                | None         | Good | Add if needed   |
| Docker              | ✅ Non-root user | **RESOLVED** | Maintain current setup |
| Dependencies        | ✅ Node.js 22 + latest deps | **RESOLVED** | Continue monitoring |
| User Input          | Not stored   | Good | Sanitize if added|
| HTTPS/HSTS          | Not configured | Pending | Enable in production |

---

**Note:** The current static nature of the site limits the attack surface. Most critical security measures have been implemented. HTTPS/HSTS configuration remains pending and should be configured at the deployment/hosting level.
