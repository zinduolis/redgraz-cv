# Portfolio Modernization PRD 
## Product Requirements Document for Enhanced Animation & Visual Experience

### 🎯 Vision
Transform the existing portfolio website into a modern, highly interactive showcase that impresses visitors with cutting-edge animations, smooth transitions, and engaging visual effects while maintaining excellent performance and accessibility.

### 📋 Current State Analysis
**Existing Tech Stack:**
- ✅ Next.js 15 with React 18
- ✅ Tailwind CSS 3.4
- ✅ Framer Motion 12.16 (underutilized)
- ✅ React Spring & Three.js components
- ✅ TypeScript & modern development workflow
- ✅ Docker setup for local development
- ✅ Yarn package management

**Current Animation Features:**
- Basic CSS transitions on hover states
- Headless UI transitions for mobile navigation
- Simple scroll-based section detection
- Basic portfolio item overlays
- Testimonial carousel with smooth scrolling

**Gaps Identified:**
- ~~Empty animations/variants.ts file~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive variants implemented
- ~~Limited use of Framer Motion capabilities~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** - Full animation system built
- Animation components created but **NOT INTEGRATED** into sections ❌ **CRITICAL GAP**
- Missing ParticleBackground and LoadingSpinner components ❌ **PENDING**
- Hero section has components available but not fully integrated ⚠️ **PARTIAL**
- Skills section still using static progress bars instead of ProgressBar component ❌ **NEEDS INTEGRATION**
- No particle effects or interactive backgrounds ❌ **PENDING**
- Static sections without scroll-triggered animations ❌ **NEEDS INTEGRATION**

## 🗑️ Work Experience & Education Removal Plan

### Rationale
- Streamline the portfolio to focus on skills and projects
- Reduce information overload for visitors
- Make the site more focused on current capabilities rather than historical timeline
- Simplify the Resume section to be purely skills-focused

### Components to Remove/Modify:
1. **Resume Component (`/src/components/Sections/Resume/index.tsx`)**:
   - Remove Education ResumeSection
   - Remove Work ResumeSection  
   - Keep only Skills ResumeSection
   - Simplify layout structure

2. **Data Structures (`/src/data/data.tsx`)**:
   - Keep `education` array (may be used elsewhere)
   - Keep `experience` array (may be used elsewhere)
   - Remove imports if completely unused

3. **Timeline Component (`/src/components/Sections/Resume/TimelineItem.tsx`)**:
   - Assess if still needed after removal
   - Remove if not used by any other component

4. **Navigation Updates**:
   - Ensure Resume section still works properly
   - Update any references to removed sections

### Files to Modify:
- `/src/components/Sections/Resume/index.tsx` - Main changes
- `/src/data/data.tsx` - Clean up if needed
- `/src/components/Sections/Resume/TimelineItem.tsx` - Remove if unused
